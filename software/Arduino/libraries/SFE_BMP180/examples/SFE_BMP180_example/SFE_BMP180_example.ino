/* SFE_BMP180 library example sketch

This sketch shows how to use the SFE_BMP180 library to read the
Bosch BMP180 barometric pressure sensor.
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11824

Like most pressure sensors, the BMP180 measures absolute pressure.
To convert this to the sea-level-compensated pressure used in weather
reports, you must provide the known altitude at which the pressure
was measured.

If, on the other hand, you want to use this sensor to measure altitude,
you will need to provide the known pressure for a given baseline altitude.
This sketch shows the use of both functions.

Hardware connections:

- (GND) to GND
+ (VDD) to 3.3V

(WARNING: do not connect + to 5V or the sensor will be damaged!)

You will also need to connect the I2C pins (SCL and SDA) to your Arduino.
The pins are different on different Arduinos:

                    SDA  SCL
Uno, Redboard, Pro  A4   A5
Mega2560, Due       20   21
Leonardo             2    3

Leave the IO (VDDIO) pin unconnected. This pin is for connecting
the BMP180 to systems with lower logic levels such as 1.8V

Have fun! -Your friends at SparkFun.

The SFE_BMP180 library uses floating-point equations developed by the
Weather Station Data Logger project: http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/

Our example code uses the "beerware" license. You can do anything
you like with this code. No really, anything. If you find it useful,
buy me a beer someday.
